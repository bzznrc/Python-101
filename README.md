# Introduction to Python Programming üêç

Hey there! üëã

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Programming** course! These are the 5 Python lessons I created at the end of 2020 for three groups of audacious friends.

If you'd like to start programming, this is the right place. You don't need to install anything‚Äîthe code runs on **Google Colab**, which is a cloud platform provided by Google. The files you see here are **IPython Notebooks** (`.ipynb` files), which are a mix of text notes and code, making it easy to follow along and interact with the code.

At the beginning of each notebook file, you'll see a blue **"Open in Colab"** link. Click on it to get started!

## Files Explained üìÑ

For each lesson, there are two types of files:

- **`.ipynb` files**: These are interactive notebooks that you can open in Google Colab. They contain both explanations and executable code cells, allowing you to read the notes and run the code directly in your browser.

- **`.py` files**: These are plain Python scripts containing only the code from the lesson. They are useful if you prefer to run the code locally on your machine or use a different development environment like VSCode or PyCharm.

## Course Outline üìö

Here's a brief overview of what each lesson covers:

### **[Lesson 1: Introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/Python-101/blob/main/1_Intro.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `1_Intro.ipynb`, `1_Intro.py`
- **Description**:
  - Learn about variables, data types, and basic operations.
  - Understand how to perform input and output in Python.
  - Get familiar with writing and running Python scripts.

### **[Lesson 2: Conditions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/Python-101/blob/main/2_Conditions.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `2_Conditions.ipynb`, `2_Conditions.py`
- **Description**:
  - Explore conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
  - Learn about comparison and logical operators.
  - Practice making decisions in your code based on conditions.

### **[Lesson 3: Loops](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/Python-101/blob/main/3_Loops.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `3_Loops.ipynb`, `3_Loops.py`

  - Learn about list operations, slicing, and methods.
  - Understand how to work with collections of data.

### **[Lesson 5: Extra](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/Python-101/blob/main/5_Extra.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `5_Extra.ipynb`, `5_Extra.py`
