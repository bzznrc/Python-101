# Python 101
Heyyy,

So these are the 5 Python lessons I've created at the end of 2020 for three groups of audacious friends.

If you'd like to start programming, this is the right place.
You don't need to install anything, and the code is run on Colab, which is a Google cloud platform. The files you see there are "IPython Notebooks", which is a mix of text notes and code. At the beginning of each file, you'll see a blue "open in Colab" link. You start from there.

Happy coding! ðŸ™‚
