    "A condition is a statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some criteria. It is typically used in `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements (as well as `while` loops, which we'll see in Episode 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition evaluates to either **True** or **False**, and the code under the condition is executed if the condition is True. If the condition is False, the code is skipped.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if x > 10:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The condition is `x > 10`. If this condition is True (i.e., if `x` is indeed greater than 10), then `\"x is greater than 10\"` will be printed. If the condition is False (i.e., `x` is 10 or less), the print statement will be skipped.\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this case, if `x` is 10 or less, we'll have the statement in the else block showing.\n",
